# Generate and Process Random Integers in Python

This repository contains a Python script that performs the following tasks:
1. Generates a list of random integers within the range [1, 5].
2. Multiplies each integer in the list by 4 to create a new list.
3. Filters the new list to include only the elements that are greater than 10.
4. Calculates and prints the sum of the filtered elements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Running the Script

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yesrkaya/python-random-integer-processing.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```sh
    cd python-random-integer-processing
    ```
3. Run the script:
    ```sh
    python data-lab1.py
    ```

### Script Description

The script prompts the user to enter the number of elements (`n`). It then generates `n` random integers within the range [1, 5], multiplies each integer by 4, filters the resulting list to include only elements greater than 10, and finally calculates and prints the sum of these elements.

### Example Output

Enter the number of elements (n): 5<br>
Initial list: [3, 1, 4, 2, 5]<br>
List after multiplying by 4: [12, 4, 16, 8, 20]<br>
Sum of elements greater than 10: 48<br>
